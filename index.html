    <h2><i>Interested in making a difference for both people and animals</i></h2>

    <p>  Hello! I’m a convergence journalist and animal scientist at the University of Missouri. From my years as a student, I have gained immense newsroom experience and animal handling experience. I'm enthusiastic to get out in the world and make a difference!</p>
      <p>I am looking to make an impact on endangered species conservation by creating content that raises awareness on the issue.
        I want to encompass all of my skills to make a positive influence on both people and animals. Check out my projects, take a look at my resume, and <a href="mailto:mschott@mail.missouri.edu">shoot me a message!</a></p>
