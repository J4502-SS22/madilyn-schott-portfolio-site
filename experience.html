<h4 style="color:green;">Venture Out</h4>
  <p>Venture Out, affiliated with the University of Missouri, specializes in group team building through outdoor experiential education programs.
    We utilize our high ropes course, climbing tower and on-the-ground challenges to bring teams together.</p>
    <p> I have been apart of Venture Out since the spring of 2020. After closing due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
      we have reopened and built our program back up. It requires 6 months of rigorous training before becoming an independent facilitator.
      Safety is the <b>#1 priority</b> and we are trained to keep a sharp eye on multiple individuals at once.
      Additionally, I am first-aid and CPR certified as well as trained for emergency situations.</p>
      <p>I became the Lead Facilitator in the spring of 2022. This meant that I withheld more responsibility and leadership within the program.
    I am responsible for scheduling courses, training new staff, and addressing employee concerns. I meet with the Venture Out coordinator weekly to plan team meetings
     and come up with ideas to improve the program.</p>

  <h4 style="color:#A79A00;">Marching Mizzou Color Guard</h4>
    <p>After proceeding through an audition process, I became a member of the Marching Mizzou Color Guard in the spring of 2020 (Band 135). I was graciously offered a spot in the Band 137 Marching Mizzou Leadership Team where I became one of four color guard section leaders for the 2022 season.
    </p> <p> As a section leader, I guide individuals through practice and encourage positive attitudes. I remain quick on my feet, and I'm responsible
      for problem-solving as situations arise.</p>
      <p>Marching Mizzou Band 137 and all of its 350 members has been invited to perform at the Kansas City Chiefs halftime show and march in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
        Marching Mizzou has presented me with so many amazing opportunities and experiences, and I'm thankful for all of the amazing memories I have made
         at this astonishing organization.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I am apart of the Inclusivity, Diversity and Equity Committee in Marching Mizzou. We brainstorm ideas on how to make
      the organization more inclusive and welcoming for everyone.</p>
