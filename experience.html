<h1 style="color:green;">Venture Out</h1>
  <p>Venture Out, affiliated with the University of Missouri, specializes in group team building through outdoor experiential education programs.
    We utilize our high ropes course, climbing tower and on-the-ground challenges to bring teams together.</p>
    <p> I have been apart of Venture Out since the spring of 2020. After closing due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
      we have reopened and built our program back up. It requires 6 months of rigorous training before becoming a full fledged facilitator.
      Safety is the #1 priority and we are trained to keep a sharp eye on multiple individuals.
      Additionally, I am first-aid and CPR certified as well as trained for emergency situations.</p>
      <p>I became the Lead Facilitator in the spring of 2022. This meant that I withheld more responsibility and leadership within the program.
    I am responsible for scheduling courses, training new staff, and addressing employee concerns. I meet with the coordinator weekly to plan team meetings
     and come up with ideas to improve the program.</p>

  <h1 style="color:#A79A00;">Marching Mizzou Color Guard</h1>
    <p>I joined Marching Mizzou Color Guard in the spring of 2020. In the spring of 2022, I became one of four captains of the team.
      As a section leader, I guide individuals through practice and encourage positive attitudes. I remain quick on my feet and I'm responsible
      for problem-solving as situations arise.</p>
      <p>I am apart of the Inclusivity, Diversity and Equality Committee in Marching Mizzou. We brainstorm ideas on how to make
      the organization more inclusive and welcoming for everyone.</p>
